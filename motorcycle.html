    <div class="at"><H4>Growing up around motorcycles</H4>
    <p>Ever since I was a little kid I was around motorcycles. There is a race track in Elkhart Lake Wisconsin called Road America which has the AMA superbike races every summer.
      My parents would take me to the races every year since I was in a stroller and it is still a continued annual tradition.
    </p>
  <P>My dad has always owned motorcycles since he was a kid so I was always around them and even riding on the back of them with my dad. It's one of the hobbies that me and him do together and we usually take a 3-4 day trip in the summer.</P></div>
